# Ardrino-Car

The goal of the project is to design a car which follows a non-linear line and returns to the starting point after it reaches the end of the line. The Arduino recieves data from line sensors which then 

The goal of this project is to create a four-wheel car that, at a starting point, follows a non-linear
line and returns back to the starting point as soon as it reaches the end of the line. The carâ€™s code allows
the vehicle to repeat its goal an infinite amount of times until the switch is off or the battery runs out of
charge. The two-line sensors will adjust the direction of the car to allow it to remain on the line.
